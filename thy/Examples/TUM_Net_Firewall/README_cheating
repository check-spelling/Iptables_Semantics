Q: What are those "_cheating" files?
A: As the name suggests, we manually modified the rulesets to yield better results. Whenever we load a _cheating file, we include the diff to the unmodified ruleset.

For example, we removed three rules at the beginning. Here is the diff to to unmodified ruleset:

 Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
 target     prot opt source               destination
-ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED,UNTRACKED
-LOG_RECENT_DROP  all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            recent: UPDATE seconds: 60 name: DEFAULT side: source
-LOG_RECENT_DROP  tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22flags: 0x17/0x02 recent: UPDATE seconds: 360 hit_count: 41 name: ratessh side: source
 LOG_DROP   all  --  127.0.0.0/8          0.0.0.0/0
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  131.159.14.206       0.0.0.0/0            multiport sports 389,636
 ACCEPT     tcp  --  131.159.14.208       0.0.0.0/0            multiport sports 389,636

We suffix everything which is based on this modified rulset (with those three rules removed) '_cheating'.
Details why it is reasonable to exclude those three rules can be found in the paper:
http://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/papers/fm15_Semantics-Preserving_Simplification_of_Real-World_Firewall_Rule_Sets.pdf

Short summary why those three rules can be removed:
1) The  RELATED,ESTABLISHED,UNTRACKED-rule: we only care about how the firewall allows connection set up.
   Once the connection is established, all further packets are automatically allowed, thus we only care how a connection can be established
2) dead rule
3) we know exactly that the rule does, we exclude it to get better results for the remaining (almost 3000) rules.

To sum up, what does '_cheating' mean: We removed three rules (with an reasonable argument).

What it does _NOT_ mean:
 * Proofs not checked by isabelle
 * contrived example
 * modified data to underline a statement
 * made-up data
 * some undocumented modifications to the data
