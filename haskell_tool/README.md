Haskell Tool
============


## Installation

Build uses `cabal` and supports the GHC 7.8.x and 7.10.x series.
To get started, use the following commands:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal build
```

With the last command, `cabal` produces a binary which can be invoked like this:

```
$ ./dist/build/iptables/iptables
```


## Example

Try this:

```
./dist/build/iptables/iptables -a ipassmt_tumi8 ../thy/Examples/TUM_Net_Firewall/iptables-save-2015-05-15_15-23-41_cheating
```


## FAQ

Q: The tool doesn't show anything for my firewall.

A: The Main.hs by default loads the `filter` table and the `FORWARD` chain. If you have a host-based firewall, you may probably replace all occurrences of `FORWARD` in Main.hs with `INPUT`.


Yeah, we will add command line switches for this in the near future ;-) The Isabelle part is very stable, the few hand-written lines of Haskell around are somewhat alpha. Fortunately, we have less than 1k lines of hand-written code, the rest is generated by Isabelle.
