parse-tests/

    Contains tests that are only checked to ensure that they parse and run
    through AutoCorres without error.

proof-tests/

    Contains tests with a hand-written Isabelle theory file. We ensure that
    these theory files correctly execute.

examples/

    As above, but these are considered "nicer" examples which we are happy
    to release.
